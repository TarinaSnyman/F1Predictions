# F1 ML Prediction Website

I just started with this project so nothing really has been done yet

## Project Overview
This project is a web application that uses machine learning models to predict Formula 1 race outcomes. Users can input driver, team, and circuit to get predictions such as chances of winning, setting the fastest lap, and pitstop performance.

## Features
- Predict race winner probabilities
- Predict fastest lap chances and lap times
- Predict pitstop performance and fastest pitstop chances
- Interactive web interface for user inputs

## Dataset
The models are trained on historical F1 race data from the past 10-20 years, including driver stats, team information, race results, and lap times.

## Getting Started
Instructions for setup, installation, and running the project will be added soon.

## Technologies Used
- Python (for data analysis and ML modeling)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for frontend)

## Future Work
- Expand dataset and features
- Improve model accuracy
- Add more interactive visualizations
- Deploy on cloud platform
